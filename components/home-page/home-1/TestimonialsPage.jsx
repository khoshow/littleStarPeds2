                Sheâ€™s the best pediatrician I have had so far with all 3 of my
                children. The staff are helpful and available when needed. Dr.
                Chowdhary is Very knowledgeable at what she does, friendly and
                caring towards my kids, and doesnâ€™t treat us like a number. She
                takes her time to make sure everything is addressed.

                whenever needed. Cancelling and scheduling appointments is easy

                Ameeta is very knowledgeable, takes great time and consideration
                in providing holistic care to all of her patients. We have never
                felt healthier in our lives than in the last 2 years being under
                her care. We have lost weight, learned how to properly eat,
                exercise and even had our children excited to go to the dr!!!
                Thatâ€™s a win

                Ameeta is absolutely amazing. She really cares about her
                patients and will take the extra time to make sure everything is
                addressed. Gone are the days of never being able to get ahold of
                a pediatrician and having to schedule appointments weeks out.
                Ameeta took my call over a weekend and promptly addressed my
                concerns. I have been going to her ever since. I highly
                recommend her to anyone who wants a provider they can rely on
                and will be there when it counts.

                Ameeta is unlike any other medical professional I've ever met.
                My child has a complicated case, and I'd been told by several
                doctors that there was nothing wrong with my son, even though I
                knew something was off. When we finally found Ameeta, she sat
                with us and actually listened. She listened as I told her
                everything, trusted my mom-intuition, and became determined to
                find answers. We eventually found that he had a brain tumor and
                needed surgery. I don't know how long it would've gone
                untreated, or how long he would've suffered, had we not finally
                found someone who would truly listen to my concerns. Since then,
                she's gone above and beyond in treatment for my son. She truly
                cares about his well-being, and doesn't operate by the typical
                standard of care; she goes out of her way to make sure that you
                AND your children are comfortable and informed. There's no one I
                would recommend more than Ameeta and Little Star Pediatrics.

                Ameeta is the best! Weâ€™ve seen a few pediatricians in the past
                prior to switching to little star and although they were great
                theyâ€™re not as thorough as Ameeta. She takes her time in
                listening to all your concerns and goes up above on asking
                different questions regarding the particular symptoms you tell
                her is going on. It makes me rest assured that my daughters are
                under great care when we visit her for yearly checks ups or sick
                appointments. I have recommended her to several family members
                and friends.

                I'm really glad we found Little Star Pediatrics. We were new to
                AZ and didn't know anyone who could recommend a pediatrician so
                I went ahead and tried Dr. Chowdhary. Her Google reviews were
                great and now I know why. We've been going to her for a year now
                and her and her staff have made us feel like family. So much
                like family to where my parents ask about Dr. Chowdhary and she
                asks about them. ðŸ˜ƒ She takes the time to talk to us about
                what's important for our kids. She's very intelligent and
                friendly that my three kids feel very comfortable around her. We
                are blessed to have her practice in our lives.

                My husband, baby and I just moved here from Nevada, and it was
                difficult finding a new doctor for our 4 month old , especially
                since her second set of vaccines was up. I found little star on
                google and saw the 5 star reviews all around and let me tell you
                they are not lying! I felt so comfortable the nurse is sooo nice
                and so is the Dr. Ameeta. They even gave me a little welcome
                packet for my little one after her vaccines! Such a great office

                Recently got insurance and as I researched online no other
                pediatric office could get them in for well check visits for
                more than a month or two out. But as soon as I called Little

                offered an appointments within 2 days. FNP Ameeta was so kind
                and went above and beyond to fully do a comprehensive well check
                for my kids. She listened to my concerns and was very patient
                with us. Iâ€™m so glad we found a good pediatrician who cares

                We love Little Star Pediatrics (especially Ameeta)!! My daughter
                was diagnosed ADHD when she was 7. Now sheâ€™s 16 and recently her
                meds have stopped working and she has been STRUGGLING,
                especially in school. I am also a nurse practitioner so itâ€™s
                very important to me that the providers we see listen to us,
                educate us and then follow evidence based guidelines to come up
                with a treatment plan, which is exactly what Ameeta did when we
                went to see her. Sometimes it takes a little while to get on the
                right meds, and thatâ€™s been true with my daughter, but during
                the whole process, Ameeta has had great communication with us
                and has and has been following my daughters symptoms closely and
                has made changes to meds appropriately and safely. And Iâ€™m very
                happy to report that sheâ€™s finally doing better!

                Ameeta is unlike any other medical professional I've ever met.
                My child has a complicated case, and I'd been told by several
                doctors that there was nothing wrong with my son, even though I
                knew something was off.When we finally found Ameeta, she sat
                with us and actually listened. She listened as I told her
                everything, trusted my mom-intuition, and became determined to
                find answers. We eventually found that he had a brain tumor and
                needed surgery. I don't know how long it would've gone
                untreated, or how long he would've suffered, had we not finally
                found someone who would truly listen to my concerns.Since then,
                she's gone above and beyond in treatment for my son. She truly
                cares about his well-being, and doesn't operate by the typical
                standard of care; she goes out of her way to make sure that you
                AND your children are comfortable and informed.There's no one I
                would recommend more than Ameeta and Little Star Pediatrics.

                So refreshing to find a provider that actually cares and listens
                to you. Definitely recommended Ameeta NP at Little Star Peds.
                She makes you feel comfortable and addresses all concerns.The
                office is clean, offers flexible hours, and the staff is super
                sweet.

                If youâ€™re looking for a place to take your kiddo that is fast,
                clean, offers convenient hours and possesses amazing patient
                care, this is it! Ameeta is thorough and ensures that your child
                is only receiving the best of care, leaving no stone unturned.
                Not only does she take excellent care of her patients, but also
                establishes that trust between the parents as the provider -
                which is hard to find! Iâ€™d give Little Star Pediatrics a ten
                star review, if I was able! Best care we have received in a long
                time!

                Ameeta NP is awesome. She is a rare find these days...so hard to
                find a practitioner that truly cares about her patients. If you
                need a new pediatrician/pediatric NP, I definitely recommend
                her. She makes your child feel comfortable and answers any
                questions you have. The office itself is clean, cute, and also,
                if you check in, there is a promo for 25% off your first visit,
                which is a great option if you don't have health insurance and
                have to pay cash. They charge $75 for cash pay/self pay (this is
                not including any additional services). Two thumbs up!
